# APIverse
APIverse - Software Engineering Project
## Description
This program provides a local API hub for PSU students, replicating placeholder APIs, weather data APIs, gradebook management, and Star Wars API endpoints. It ensures reliability, security with OAuth, and cost-effective cloud deployment using Docker and GCP's Cloud Run.
## Technical Stack
We plan to use Python with Flask for API implementation because of its simplicity, flexibility, and robust community support. If a frontend is needed for interactive API testing, we plan to use React.
